# VG-Shmup
My first ever video game. Tracking my code changes over time.

This project was a recovery from dibailtating mental health issues. 
Pico 8 and the Lazy Devs tutotials have been very helpful in reawakening a creative part of me.

This is the result of these tutorials -- I'm not even done with the tutorials yet but I'm interested in seeing my code changes over time. As well as being able to revert changes or otherwise figure out how I fucked something up.

Currently this project is a Star Trek themed shmup. The first ship is the USS Defiant. The enemy are the Borg and they're done sending just a cube or two. They're sending a million cubes into Federation space and you need to take command to save hundreds of billions of lives! Do you have what it takes to survive an impossible onslaught?
